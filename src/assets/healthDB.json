      "prevention": "Eliminate sharp objects that can injure the rabbit.",
      "treatment": "Clip the fur around abscess, then lance and remove the pus. Disinfect with peroxide and use an approved antibiotic ointment or powder to promote healing."

      "disease": "Bladder sludge",
      "cause": "High calcium diet, low water intake, overweight, lack of places to urinate, kidney disease, or cystitis.",
      "symptoms": "Lessening of appetite, fewer or cessation of droppings, blood may appear in the urine, loud painful grinding of the teeth, lethargy, unwillingness to move, hunched posture, pressing their abdomen on the ground, perineal scalding, straining or inability to urinate and passing thick, white, toothpaste like urine.",
      "prevention": "Drink more water, avoid feeding alfalfa hay and high calcium vegestables (kale, carrot tops, spinach, parsley, and spring greens)",
      "treatment": "Urethral calculi are usually removed by flushing the stone back into the bladder and performing a cystotomy to remove it/them from the bladder."

      "prevention": "Do not let unaffected rabbits in contact with rabbits that have ear canker.",
      "treatment": "Use a cotton swab to apply mineral, vegetable or olive oil over all visible crust. Usually one or two treatments is sufficient. "

      "prevention": "Feed high fiber diet, encourage physical exercise, have your rabbit checked regularly by veterinarian.",
      "treatment": "Fluid therapy, syringe feeding, antibiotic, pain relivers, anti-inflammatory medications."

      "symptoms": "Increased respiration rate (panting) prostration, and excessive saliva discharge. Pregnant does and young in the nest box are most susceptible.",
      "prevention": "Provide shade, adequate air movement, and plenty of cool water on a hot day. Wet burlap in cage will aid in cooling. ",
      "treatment": "Rabbits suffering from heat exhaustion can be immersed in lukewarm water to reduce body temperature to the normal 101-1040F. Apply a cool compress to the ears. "

      "treatment": "Tetracycline in feed may be effective in an uncomplicated case. For accurate treatment, the organism needs to be cultured and identified."
